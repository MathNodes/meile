# TODO
* Wallet support (v1.0)
* Keyring passphrase support
* .deb packaging with sentinel-cli (v0.5.0-0.6.0)
* Improve Subsciption info table alogrithm. There is a faster approach. 
* Improve intial loading time (mostly dependent on RPC)
* resolv.conf issues when disconnecting (sometimes) - may be up to the user to configure their own resolv.conf settings to ensure disconnect doesn't leave them stranded
* Sort functionality of Nodes (v0.6.0)
* FIAT on-ramp (v2.0) - Requires wallet support
